# Pipelined-32-bit-Processor-in-Logisim
This project was for the computer architecture course and implements a 32-bit pipelined processor using Logisim Evolution, featuring a full datapath, control unit, ALU, register file, hazard detection, and forwarding logic. It executes a custom instruction set through hexadecimal machine code loaded into ROM.
